"""Production-file line-count ratchet — god-file growth must be deliberate.

Round 3 claims 2/4 residue: the repo's largest files (harness_bridge,
gate_cmds, phase_cmds, fr_cmds, ...) are safety-critical surfaces
deliberately NOT decomposed this round (the M2-M4 plangen split handled the
one with a proven drift wound). This ratchet does for file growth what
test_patch_discipline does for private patches, with one deliberate
difference spelled out here: line counts legitimately grow, so ceilings MAY
be raised — but only in the same commit as the growth, with the reason in
the commit message. The product is diff-visibility of growth, not an
absolute cap. A file not listed in _LINE_CEILING must stay below
_GOD_FILE_THRESHOLD entirely; lowering a ceiling after shrinking a file is
manual, same as the patch ratchet.
